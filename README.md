# Jetify ðŸŽµ âœˆï¸Ž

Do you ever wish you knew what events were going on in your location, or what events were going on in a location you were travelling to?
Jetify is an app that allows you to see events happening in your area or the area of your choice and creates a playlist based on those events. Checkout future events happening in your area or find out what concerts are going on, on your next vacation.

Here is a demo for Jetify: https://jetify.herokuapp.com/
